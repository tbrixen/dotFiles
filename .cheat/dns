Lookup of dr.dk. (notice trailing dot is written for clarity) is done (in case of no caching) by querying a root dns server about who owns dr. From that answer select one of the name servers and ask for dr.dk. See example by issuing dig +trace dr.dk.

Getting ip from dns
```
$ dig +short dr.dk
159.20.6.38
$ host dr.dk
dr.dk has address 159.20.6.38
dr.dk mail is handled by 20 dr-dk.mx2.comendosystems.net.
dr.dk mail is handled by 10 dr-dk.mx1.comendosystems.com.
```

Lookup on specific name server
```
dig @1.1.1.1 dr.dk
